 For the DODE sequences, the parameters are listed in different columns and each row is a measurement 
 All sequence parameters are given in SI units (m,s,T, ..), except for the B-values and B-matrices which 
 are provided in the commonly used s/mm2 units. The sesequences are described in Ianus et al NeuroImage 2018
 1 - G - Gradient Strength (same for G1 and G2) [T/m]
 2 - gx1 - normalized x component of gradient 1  
 3 - gy1 - normalized y component of gradient 1 
 4 - gz1 - normalized z component of gradient 1 
 5 - gx2 - normalized x component of gradient 2  
 6 - gy2 - normalized y component of gradient 2 
 7 - gz2 - normalized z component of gradient 2 
 8 - smalldel - gradient duration [s]
 9 - freq - oscillation frequency of the trapezoidal cos-like waveform [Hz]
 10 - ts - separation time [s]
 11 - rt - rise time of the gradient [s]
 12 - TE - echo time [s]
 13 - B - total b-value of the sequence (trace of the Bmatrix) [s/mm2]
 14 - Bxx - component of the Bmatrix [s/mm2]
 15 - Bxy - component of the Bmatrix [s/mm2]
 16 - Bxz - component of the Bmatrix [s/mm2]
 17 - Byy - component of the Bmatrix [s/mm2]
 18 - Byz - component of the Bmatrix [s/mm2]
 19 - Bzz - component of the Bmatrix [s/mm2]
