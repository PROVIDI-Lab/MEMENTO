 For both the shells and the grid PGSE signals, the parameters are listed in different columns and each row is a measurement 
 All sequence parameters are given in SI units (m,s,T, ..) with exception of the b-value, which is given in the common s/mm2 unit.
 1 - G - Gradient Strength [T/m]
 2 - gx1 - normalized x component of gradient  
 3 - gy1 - normalized y component of gradient 
 4 - gz1 - normalized z component of gradient 
 5 - smalldel - gradient duration [s]
 6 - DELTA - time between the gradients [s]
 7 - rt - rise time of the gradient [s]
 8 - TE - echo time [s] 
 9 - TR - repetition time [s]
 10 - B - total b-value of the sequence [s/mm2]
